# Neural network and genetic algorithms
A personal Python project manually programming genetic algorithm to learn the weights of manually programmed artificial neural network. A meta genetic algorithm is used to tune the hyperparamters of the neural network. This is then compared with a support vector machine with an RBF kernel. The SVM has its hyperparameters tuned using a grid search.
